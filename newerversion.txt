		<h1> The Inside </h1>
		
		<h2> System Unit Overview (Before) </h2>
		<p>
			We examined a Dell Workstation System Unit. This is what it looked like before we extracted the components:
 
		</p>
		<h2> Components <h2>
		<h3>Power Supply <h3>
		<p>
		   The power supply unit is the largest component in the system unit, by volume and mass. It is 
		   in the shape of a rectangular prism and slides into a compartment along the side of the unit.
		   It also has a large, circular fan. It provides electricity for the whole system, converting 
		   the input current into either 5v or 12v, depending on what the computer needs. The 5v supply
		   powers the circuit board and the 12v powers motor-driven components, like the HDD.
		<p>
		<h3> Central Processing Unit (CPU) <h3>
		<p>
		   The CPU is essentially the brain of the computer. It is small and square shaped with a large,
		   circular fan of its own. It needs its own fan because it processes millions of bytes of data
		   per second. The job of the CPU is to process data and turn it into information by performing
		   simple arithmetic and logical operations. It also gives instructions to the hardware components
		   on how to act. 
		<p>
		<h3> Motherboard <h3>
		<p>
		   The motherboard is a flat, green circuit board upon which many components of the system are found.
		   It holds the CPU, RAM, ROM, expansion slots, power connectors, and any other chips / cards. 
		   The board allows communication between these different parts and connects them to the power supply. 
		<p>
		<h3> Random Access Memory (RAM) Stick <h3>
		<p>		    
		   The RAM stick is a thin, long, green chip that connects to the motherboard in its own slot. RAM is a way
		   of storing information temporarily (also known as volatile memory). Any time the the computer is shut down,
		   the RAM is cleared and all information within it is lost. It is called random access memory because when 
		   data is needed, it goes straight to the file and can access data in “random” orders. Many different units 
		   within the system such as the PC use RAM for storing data from running programs. 
		<p>
		<h3> Read-Only Memory (ROM) Chip <h3>
		<p>
		   The ROM chip is a thin, black, rectangular chip that right onto the motherboard. ROM is a way of storing 
		   information permanently. However, this information is pre-written (already programmed) onto the chip when
		   the computer was built and ROM cannot be altered once it is programmed. It can only be read, hence the name.
		   As well, the computer can only extract data from it in sequential order, unlike random access memory. 
		   One major importance of the ROM chip is that it contains the procedures needed for the system unit to start
		   up and shut down. 
		<p>
		<h3> Hard Disk Drive (HDD) <h3>
		<p>
		   The hard disk drive is a data storage device, it stores the operating system, software titles and most other 
		   files. The Hard Disk Drive is usually the size of a paperback book, but the weight is much heavier. The HDD 
		   is connected your PC into the Hard Disk Drive through the plug connectors to the circuit board. The flexible
		   connector carries data data from circuit board to the read & write head. The read-write head on the read-write 
		   arm stores data and pick up data to send to the PC. The actuator moves the read-write arm around. The magnetic 
		   platter(the circle in the middle of the Hard Disk Drive) stores the data in binary form. 
		<p>
		<h3> Expansion Slots <h3>
		<p>
		   The expansions slots are located on the motherboard and look like thin, long compartments that cards can fit into. 
		   Expansion slots are used to add devices to the system, connecting the device(s) to the CPU and the power supply. 
		   They allow the computer to grow, providing additional functions through cards like video cards and sound cards.
